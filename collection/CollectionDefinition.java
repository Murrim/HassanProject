	/**
	 *  Collection :
	 *      (Collection itself is an interface that possess a combination of classess and interfaces
	 *       that helps us to store a group of individual entity and represent as a single object.)
	 *       
	 *  Purpose of collection:
	 *     
	 *       We use collection to over come the issues of using Array because array is fixed size and can
	 *       only store homogeneous data while by using collection, we can vary size and can store both
	 *       homogeneous and hetrogeneous data.
	 *       
	 *  Main interfaces of collection:
	 *  
	 *      1)- List   2)- Set  3)- Queue 
	 *       These are three main interfaces of collection and each of them stores mmultiple classes.
	 *       
	 *      1) List Interface :
	 *         
	 *         list interface includes three classes :
	 *          i)- ArrayList   ii)- LinkedList  iii)- Vector (vector stores another class called Stock).
	 *          
	 *   * To connect interface to interfaces we use extends, while to connesct interfaces to classess we use
	 *     implements and to connect classess to classess we use extends.
	 *     
	 *     All list classes come form package java.util (very important interview question).
	 *     
	 *     
	 *     Legacies in collection :
	 *     
	 *       Vector
	 *       Stock
	 *       Dictionary
	 *       HashTable
	 *       Properties
	 *        These classes are legacies in collection.
	 *      
	 *    
	 *       
	 *       
	 *       
	 *
